# How to use this app

Welcome to the **MPA management Explorer**.  

This application lets you explore how human activities occurring in Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) relate to biodiversity conservation risks, and simulate potential management actions. 

This information was generated using public data about human activities at sea, global estimates of species distribution, and conservation assessment listed in the IUCN Red List. Risk was estimated from an understanding of Vulnerabilities and Hazards at each MPA site derived from this information. For a full detail of the methodological approach to estimate the occurence of species and activities and to estimate vulnerability, hazard, and risk we refer you to an upcoming publication [doi to be inserted here once available].  
In the interim, the full method and data sources  is available to download as a pdf [here](docs/methods_and_data_sources.pdf).

## What this app uses

- **SEnetworks (Nov 2024)**: A named list of bipartite graphs (activities ↔ species groups) for ~15,971 MPAs.
- **MPA metadata (`mpa_metadata.csv`)**: Contains MPA identifiers, country, name, and two risk metrics:
  - `risk_richness`: how many conservation risks are present (breadth).
  - `risk_complexity`: how diverse/complex those risks are (entropy-like measure).
- **Risk simulation (`mpa_risk_df.csv`)**: A data matrix used by the `actions()` function to recompute biodiversity conservation risk richness/complexity when one activity is removed.

> **Important:** Read the project documentation before interpreting results. This app was created as part of the **Biodiversa+ project mpa4sustainability**, using data collated over 2021–2023.

## Navigating the app

### 1) **Networks**
- Use the sidebar to select a **Country** and then an **MPA**.
- The network shows:
  - **Species groups** (white nodes) - these are [ISSCAAP](https://www.fao.org/fishery/static/ASFIS/ISSCAAP.pdf) taxonomic groups, the species name of the group can be at time quite different from all species represented in the group.
  - **Activities** (grey nodes) - these are activity groups that can be related to conservation threats categories used in the IUCN Red List classification
  - **Edges**: 
    - **Blue** = ecosystem services provisioning / receiving
    - **Orange** = conservation threats
    - **weight** = proportion of the species, out of all species assessed in the taxonomic group, that produces ecosystem services or is threatened by exposure to the activities.
  - Edge **width** scales with |weight|.

- Beneath the graph you’ll see **risk badges** for the selected MPA:
  - The current biodiversity conservation **risk richness** and **risk complexity** values (see methods).
  - Their **percentile ranks** compared to all MPAs in the dataset.

### 2) **Network analysis**
- Two bar charts split by node type:
  - **Species groups**: 
    - **Blue** = out-strength (services provided to activities)
    - **Red**  = in-strength (threats from activities)
  - **Activities**:
    - **Blue** = in-strength (services received from species)
    - **Red**  = out-strength (threats to species)
- You can optionally limit plots to **top K** nodes for readability.

In-strength is the sum of the weights of all links arriving to a node. Out-strength is the sum of the weights of all links departing a node.

### 3) **Management simulations**
- Click **Run simulations** to evaluate the effect of removing of each activity (one at a time).
- Three outputs:
  - **Richness barplot**: the **new richness** value (or its **percentile rank**) after removing each activity, with a dashed baseline line.
  - **Complexity barplot**: the **new complexity** value (or **percentile rank**), with baseline.
  - **Change in Ecosystem service provision (in-degree sum - Δ)**: the change in the total **in-degree** across activity nodes when one activity is removed.This corresponds to potential loss of ecosystem service provision if an activity is removed.
  
- Display mode:
  - **New values**: shows recomputed richness/complexity.
  - **Quantile rank (%)**: converts new values into percentile ranks against all MPAs.
- You can **sort bars** by display value and **download** the simulation results.

### 4) **Summary of findings**
- Generates badges summarizing:
  - How many activities occur in the selected MPA and where it ranks in **risk richness** and **risk complexity** (percentiles).
  - The **species group** contributing the most **ecosystem services** (largest out-strength among species).
  - The **activity** that receives the most **ecosystem services** (largest in-strength).
  - The **activity** producing the most **conservation threats** (largest out-strength).
    
  - Management focus:
    - Which activity’s removal yields the **lowest new richness**.
    - Which activity’s removal yields the **lowest new complexity**.
    
  - A caution list of activities with highest **in-strength** (services received), indicating potential trade-offs if restricting them.

## Interpreting results

- **Percentile ranks**: 
  - Ranks are empirical percentiles across all MPAs in the dataset.
  - A high percentile rank indicates higher relative risk (richness or complexity) compared to peers.
- **Simulations**:
  - Activity removal is simulated **one activity at a time** (no multi-activity interactions).
  - Results depend on how activities map to the risk matrix

## Tips & troubleshooting

- For any issues contact David Lusseau (davlu@dtu.dk)

- If you change the data files in a local copy of the app the following issues may arise:
  - If the network doesn’t render:
    - Check that `mpa_id` in metadata matches names of `SEnetworks`.
    - Ensure edges have a `weight` attribute.
  - If simulations don’t run:
    - Confirm `mpa_risk_df.csv` exists and contains the selected `mpa_id`.
    - Activity names must match the function’s **netactivities** mapping.
- The simplest action to redress those issues is to redownload the app (these will not arise if you use the app online)

## Reproducibility & export

- Consider saving your selections (country, MPA) and display settings for consistent reporting.
